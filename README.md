# :bulb: Speed Math -> sMath
A simple little vue app for testing your math strength. Answer 10 questions as quickly as possible and your time is tracked with a built in timer.


## :rocket: Build

sMath is a simple single component VueJS app, I used [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) but you could easily use your builder of choice.

Local Development:
```
npm run dev
```

npm run prod 
```
